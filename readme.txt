I used the same concept as we learned in "deck of cards" assignment with a little extra javascript that i got a little help from
W3Schools.com. There is minimul javascript and a bit of css on this gallery becasue i did not fully understood the javascript we
learned in the last few classes.

I wanted to use a slideshow view of the gallery on click but it was overwhelming for now. Instead i used a simple "facebook" style
gallery with thumbnail sized images enlarged to be viewable on click. Users can exit the image either clicking the cross button or
anywhere else.

I learned that creating this gallery was in sense less time consuming and less coding, by using javascript, once one fully grasped
the concept of it, compared to adding a bunch of img tags or picture tags in html.
